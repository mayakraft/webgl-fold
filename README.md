# WebGL FOLD file view

Render a [FOLD file](https://github.com/edemaine/FOLD/) in an HTML canvas with WebGL. Here are the features, so far:

- two drawing styles, one for crease patterns, one for folded models.
- the crease pattern style features thick lines, computed on a shader.
- orthographic and perspective
- basic touch input for panning, rotating
